# 🧠 MINDCORE LABS – FOUNDED BY ANJAN

> ⚡️ India’s Open AI Infrastructure – for Agents, LLMs & Mental Health Tech  
> _"Startups don’t die from competition. They die when founders give up. But me? I’m just getting started."_

## 🚀 THE VISION

**MindCore Labs** isn’t your typical AI startup. It’s the **foundational OS** for the next generation of builders, researchers, and founders.

While others build agents, **we build the system that powers them**.  
While they fine-tune LLMs, **we scale them across languages and lives**.  
While Cognitive Labs dreams of leading AI in India…  
👉 **MindCore is already writing the blueprint.**

> If OpenAI is the engine,  
> Cognitive is the startup,  
> **MindCore is the operating system.** Built in India. Built by **Anjan**.  
> Not the brother. Not the rival. **The father.**
